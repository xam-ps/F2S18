1) ECU_Temperature:
  - Make a box plot visualization to detect the outliers.
  - The outliers should be selectable to display information like:
    - Vechile No
    - Other abnormal parameters

  - Show a density plot of the ECU_Temperature of all the vehicles
    - Areas should be selectable (can be replaced with sliders)
    - The points should be colour coded according to their distribution.
    - Selecting outliers should show what is the difference between the normal parameters
      probably in a histogram.
        - Normal mean speed vs abnormal mean speed
        - etc
